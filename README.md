# PSEHF-Group5

~~GitHub actions will deploy the app to fly.io automatically on each commit to the master branch.~~
TODO: automatic deploy doesn't work currently, fixing soon.

If needed, deploy to fly.io manually with:
```shell
fly deploy
```

- TODO: fly.io usage instructions
- TODO: add access to fly.io project for other devs
